            <h1>Career Summary</h1>
            <p>In May of 2015, I graduated. 15 days later, I joined <a href="https://www.tcs.com/" target="_blank">Tata Consultancy Services</a> pinning my professional career with a great headstart</p>

            <p>I loved working and contributing in building technology that can be consumed meaningfully. I strived to keep the spirit in my alive throughout. A year and half later, I was presented with an exciting opportunity to be part of a team that effectively structures how technology is consumed in the enterprise. This experience literally shifted my perspective and opened up spaces of creativity to explore. I loved every day of my work and I couldn't wait for the sunrise to go and contribute</p>

I meet internal stakeholders regularly and understand their business and evaluate startups according to opportunities and needs.

            <h5>Innovation Lab</h5>
